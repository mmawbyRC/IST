  <h2> Bitmaps </h2>
  <p> Definition: a representation in which each item corresponds to one or more bits of information, especially the information used to control the display of a computer screen. or A bitmap is a type of memory organization or image file format used to store digital images. The term bitmap comes from the computer programming terminology, meaning just a map of bits, a spatially mapped array of bits </p>

  <h2>  Run length encoding </h2>
  <p> Run-length encoding (RLE) is a very simple form of lossless data compression in which runs of data (that is, sequences in which the same data value occurs in many consecutive data elements) are stored as a single data value and count, rather than as the original run.</p>
  <p> Below is an example of a RLE. </p>
