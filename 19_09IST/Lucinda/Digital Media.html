<h2>Text encoding</h2>

<p>Text encoding consist of various encoding schemes where letters and other characters are each assigned a unique number
  which is used to identify them. These schemes allow for storage and transmission of text on computers. Several schemes
  include ASCII and Unicode. Codes such as ASCII provide a unified and universal system for computers to operate and follow. ASCII is an important system as it provides computers with a common language to communicate in.</p>

<h2>Bitmap Encoding</h2>
<p>Bitmap encoding is a process where data is converted to an image consisting of pixels. Bitmaps are an image raster file format. To store bitmaps on your computer, each different coloured pixel is given a different value. These numbers are then arranged into a series of numbers. To open the bitmap again, the code is decoded and shown into image form.<div>This is an example of an image that has been created using Bitmap.</div></p>

<h2>Run Length Encoding Compression</h2
<p>Run length encoding compression is a form of lossless data compression. It compresses data by reducing the size of repeating characters. To do this, the repeating characters are encodes into two bytes. One of the bytes consists of the run count which means how many times the character is repeated. The second byte represents the value of the character which is called the run value and be any number from 0-255. This compression method can be used on any type of data.
