  <h2>text encoding</h2>
  <p>Text encoding, also known as character encoding, refers to the process of digitzing text to different encoding schemes, such as ASCII or Unicode.</p>
  <img src="textencoding.png" alt="an example of text encoding">
  <p>This photo demonstrates what text encoding is. Black boxes are represented as 1s, whereas white boxes are left blank.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the photo makes use of binary code (a coding language presented as combinations of 0s and 1s) and presents ASCII letters through their equivalent binary codes.</p>
  <h2>bitmaps</h2>
  <img src="bitmap.png" alt="an example of a 4-bit bitmap">
  <p>The above photo is an example of a 4-bit bitmap. This bitmap is composed of a number of different colours, arranged in a combination which, when viewed all together in the correct order, creates an image. In this case, the bitmap has created an image of internet meme Nyan Cat.</p>
  <h2>run length encoding</h2>
  <p>Run length encoding, also known as RLE, is a form of lossless data compression. It turns colour and pixels into binary.</p>
  <p>This video explains what rle is all about:</p>
