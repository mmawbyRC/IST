  <h2>10 IST</h2>
  <h2>AI, Modeling, Simulations, Data Science</h2>
  <p>Students were challenged to do an in-depth study of emerging
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications. Taking on perspectives
    other than their own, they justified preferred AI futures based
    on social and ethical impacts. </p>
<p>Students are learning basic Data Science to help understand
  how AI could work through modelling and simulation. This includes
  employing analysis and visualisation skills on bigger data sets.
