  <h2>Information and Software Technology</h2>

  <p>IST students learn about, choose and use appropriate information
    and software technology and develop an informed awareness of its
    capacities, scope, limitations and implications. Through
    experiential and collaborative tasks, students engage in
    processes of analysing, designing, producing, testing,
    documenting, implementing and evaluating information and
    software technology-based solutions. Creative, critical
    and meta-cognitive thinking skills are developed through
    students' practical involvement in projects. </p>
