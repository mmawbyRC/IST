<p>Good time management is essential to achieving your goals at school this year. There are many strategies that will help you achieve more in less time. Here are some suggestions. </p>
</div> <br>
<div class='timemanagekey'>
  <h2>Multi-task: Do more than one thing at once</h2>
  <p>You will achieve more in the same amount of time. For example, revise your Science notes or read a novel for English on the bus ride home.</p>
  </div><br>
<div class='timemanagekey'>
    <h2>Plan: Make a commitment to tasks that lie ahead</h2>
    <p>Create a planner that clearly details your tasks and commitments for the week, month and year ahead. Display your planner where you will see it each day. Don't forget to include extra-curricular sports and activities as well as free time so as you have the right healthy balance between work and play.</p>
  </div><br>
<div class='timemanagekey'>
  <h2>Prioritise: Put things in order of importance</h2>
  <p>if you have a project due this Friday and an essay due the following Monday, work on both but spend more time on the project that is due first</p>
</div><br>
<div class='timemanagekey'>
  <h2>When in doubt about what to do first - do something</h2>
  <p>If you hit the wall and can't thik of what to write (writer's block) just write whatever comes into your head for a while until your train of thought starts moving again.

  <h1><mark>Balancing Sport and Study</mark></h1>
  <p>Being active is a great way to release endorphines and give your brain a rest from school and homework. Participating in sporting activities is also good for your wellbeing for a variety of reasons such as:</p>
  <ul class='esul'>
    <li class='esli'>Reduces the risk of obesity</li>
    <li class='esli'>Increases your cardiovasular fitness</li>
    <li class='esli'>Improves your coordination and balance</li>
    <li class='esli'>Helps in the growth of your bones and muscles</li>
    <li class='esli'>Improves your sleep</li>
    <li class='esli'>Assists in confidence building</li>
    <li class='esli'>Teaches you the importance of leadership and cooperation</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It is also important to remember that just because you participate in sporting activities this doesn't mean your grades will suffer. In fact sport is a great way to relax and re-energise your mind.</p>
