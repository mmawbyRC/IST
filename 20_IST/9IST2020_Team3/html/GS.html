  <p>Stress is a natural physiological response required to help you deal with challenging situations. Good amounts of stress can enhance your performance, particularly during exams. Extended periods of stress are not so good for you. Learning how to cope with different level of stress is an important way to look after your wellbeing. </p>
</div> <br> <div class='stresstestkey'><h2>What stresses you out?</h2>
      <p>Take some time to pinpoint what makes you feel stressed. During senior secondary school, common stressors include high workload, time constraints, exams, money problems, relationship issues and high expectations by teachers and parents. Have the courage to change the things you can change and accept the things you canâ€™t.</p>
