      <p> Goal Setting is an important skill that every high school student should know! Goal setting allows students to keep track of their priorities and plan out their sessions. Reflecting on what you could do differently next time is part of the evaluation process. There is no point in making the same mistakes and hoping for a better result! </p>
    </div> <br> <div class='goalkey4'><h2>How do you set goals? </h2>
          <p>One of the ways that you can set goals is by using the <strong>SMART</strong> method. <br><br> <strong>S</strong> - Specific   - What exactly do you want to achieve? The more specific and detailed your description, the bigger the chance you'll get exactly that!!Your goal should be clear and specific, otherwise you won't be able to focus your efforts or feel truly motivated to achieve it! <br> <br> <strong>M</strong> - Measureable  It's important to have measurable goals, so that you can track your progress and stay motivated. Assessing progress helps you to stay focused, meet your deadlines, and feel the excitement of getting closer to achieving your goal.<br> <br><strong>A</strong> - Achievable Your goal also needs to be realistic and attainable to be successful. In other words, it should stretch your abilities but still remain possible. When you set an achievable goal, you may be able to identify previously overlooked opportunities or resources that can bring you closer to it.<br><br><strong>R</strong>  - Relevant This step is about ensuring that your goal matters to you, and that it also aligns with other relevant goals. We all need support and assistance in achieving our goals, but it's important to retain control over them. So, make sure that your plans drive everyone forward, but that you're still responsible for achieving your own goal.<br><br><strong>T</strong> - Time-oriented Every goal needs a target date, so that you have a deadline to focus on and something to work toward. This part of the SMART goal criteria helps to prevent everyday tasks from taking priority over your longer-term goals.<br></p>

        <br> <div class='goalkey4'><h2>Tips and Tricks for Effective Goal Setting</h2>
              <p> When doing goals, there are some things that you should avoid doing when making these goals.<br>
               <p><strong>1.</strong> Always use I, this makes it more personal and easier to achieve it<br></p>
               <p><strong>2.</strong> Beware of setting goals that target someone in particular. It can really hurt them and make things worse. You should never compare yourself to others. Instead, <strong> look up to them! </strong><br></p>
               <p><strong>3.</strong> Model after people. There are a lot of people who we look up to, try to find someone who has already achieved their goals and follow their motivation.<br></p>
              <p><strong> 4.</strong> Visualise your success. It is has been proven to help you be better at performance and will change behaviour to be more attentive and engaged.<br></p>
              <p><strong>5.</strong> Release your doubts. Telling negative things will make you feel worse and less likely to achieve it, with a good attiude.<br></p>

          <br>  <div class='goalkey1'><h1><mark>Evaluating Your Goals: </mark></h1>
            <p> As Harvey McKay once said "Failures don't plan to fail, but rather that they fail to plan. And for a plan to succeed, you must inspect the plan carefully." <br>
              <strong>Only by evaluating your goals and the steps you are taking to get there will you have a chance of success.</strong>
              <br>As you work on your smart goals, you want to evaluate whether or not they're working to get you what you want.
              <p> Are the tasks you're doing moving toward success? </p>
              <p> If not, why not? What can you tweak, change or get rid of to make them work?</p>
