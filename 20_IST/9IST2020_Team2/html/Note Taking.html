           Note Taking
        </h1>
        <h3 class="header">Note taking is one of the most important activities for students. Taking notes will help you recall information that is hard to remember. This is especially crucial when preparing for an exam. Note taking isn’t as easy as it sounds, it’s not about writing down everything you hear. Taking notes is about summarising core concepts as precisely as possible in your own words. A note-taking method will help you to prepare for exams and to review quick concepts after class.
          It can help you organise your notes, so you don’t have to worry about losing them.</h3>

      <h2>The Outline Method</h2>
      <p>The outline method is one of the best and easiest note-taking methods. It lets you organise your notes in a structured form, saving you a lot of time for reviewing and editing. This method requires you to structure your notes in the form of an outline by using bullet points to represent different topics and their subtopics. Start writing main topics on the far left of the page and add related subtopic in bullet points below using indents.</p>

      <li>Highlights the key points of the lecture in a logical way</li>
      <li>Ease of use allows the students to focus</li>
      <li>Reduces the reviewing and editing time</li>
      <li>Gives a proper and clean structure to your notes</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cons</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Not suitable for subjects like chemistry and math that comprise of formulas and charts</li>
      <li>Doesn’t work well if the class doesn’t follow a certain structure</li>

    <h2>The Cornell Method</h2>
    <p>The Cornell method is used for remembering key ideas. The page is divided into three or four sections starting from one row at the top for title and date (optional) and one at the bottom along with two columns in the center. 30% of width should be kept in the left column while the remaining 70% for the right column.</p>
    <img src="../images/cornellnotes.jpg" alt="Cornell Method"><br>
    <p>All notes from the class go into the main note-taking column. The smaller column on the left is for comments, questions or hints about the notes. The space at the bottom is used to summarise the notes. </p>
    <h3>Pros</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A quicker way to take, review, and organize your notes</li>
      <li>Summarizes all the information in a systematic manner</li>
      <li>Helps in effective learning as it enables to absorb information in a shorter time</li>
      <li>Helps you to extract main ideas</li>
      <li>Cuts down time for reviewing</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cons</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Pages need to be prepared before a class</li>
    <li>Requires some time for reviewing and summarising the key concepts</li>
  </ul>

      <h2>The Charting Method</h2>
      <p>This method is ideal for notes that involve a lot of information in the form of facts and statistics. The information is organised in several columns, similar to a table. Each column represents a category which makes the rows easily comparable. </p>
      <img src="../images/Charting-method.jpg" alt="Charting Method"><br>
      <h3>Pros</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Information is clearly structured</li>
  <li>Fantastic for reviewing</li>
  <li>Notes are easily comparable</li>
  <li>A lot of information can be memorized rather quickly</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Very time-consuming method</li>
  <li>Barely makes sense to apply this method in a class where the content isn’t clear beforehand</li>
  <li>Doesn’t work for information that can’t easily be categorized</li>
</ul>

         <h2>Mind mapping method</h2>
         <p>A mind map helps you to organise notes by dividing them into branches, enabling you to establish relationships between the topics. Start with writing the main topic at the top of the map. Keep dividing it into subtopics as you go down.</p>
         <img src="../images/mindmap.jpg" alt="Mindmap Method"><br>
         <h3>Pros</h3>
         <ul>
           <li>Visually appealing</li>
           <li>Can be used for noting down detailed information but in a concise form</li>
           <li>Allows easy editing of the notes</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cons</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>While mapping your notes, you might run out of space on a single page</li>
          <li>Can be confusing if the information is wrongly placed while taking notes</li>
        </ul>
