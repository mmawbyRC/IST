<h3>
  Multi-Task: Do more than one thing at once
</h3>
<p>
  You will achieve more in the same amount of time. For example, revise your science notes or read a novel for English on the bus ride home.

<h3>
  Plan: Make a commitment to tasks that lie ahead
</h3>
<p>
  Create a planner that clearly details your tasks and commitments for the week, month and year ahead. Display your planner where you will see it each day. Don't forget to include extracurricular sports and activities as well as free time so you have the right healthy balance between work and play.

<h3>
  Prioritise: Put things in order of importance
</h3>
<p>
  If you have a project due this Friday in an essay due the following Monday, work on both but spend more time on the project that is due first.

</p>

<h3>
  Take regular rest and snack breaks
</h3>
<p>
  Rest revitalises your body and brain. Food gives your muscles and brain energy to burn. Although you are usually sitting when studying, you burn a tremendous number of calories when you are actively using your brain. Rest and feeding your brain keep you working at your best.

<h3>
  When in doubt about what to do first - do something
</h3>
<p>
  If you hit the wall and can't think of what to write (writers block) just write whatever comes into your head for a while until your training thoughts start moving again.
