</h3>

<h3>
  Take regular rest and snack breaks
</h3>
<p>
  Rest revitalises your body and brain. Food gives your muscles and brain energy to burn. Although you are usually sitting when studying, you burn a tremendous number of calories when you are actively using your brain. Rest and feeding your brain keep you working at your best. If you like, you can take a crack at the duck game on the <a href="HomePage.html">Home Page</a>. But don't forget to go back to studying.

<h3>
  When in doubt about what to do first - do something
</h3>
<p>
  If you hit the wall and can't think of what to write (writers block) just write whatever comes into your head for a while until your training thoughts start moving again. This gives your brain time to regenerate and get into a studying focus. This technique also allows your to brainstorm many ideas about whatever you are working on, expanding your knowledge on the subject.
