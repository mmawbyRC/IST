<h3>
  Prioritise: Put things in order of importance
</h3>
<p>
  If you have a project due this Friday in an essay due the following Monday, work on both but spend more time on the project that is due first. Always prioritise the tasks due first, as to get them done quicker and you can focus on other tasks you have due.

<h3>
  Take regular rest and snack breaks
</h3>
<p>
  Rest revitalises your body and brain. Food gives your muscles and brain energy to burn. Although you are usually sitting when studying, you burn a tremendous number of calories when you are actively using your brain. Rest and feeding your brain keep you working at your best. If you like, you can take a crack at the duck game on the Home Page. But don't forget to go back to studying.

<h3>
  When in doubt about what to do first - do something
</h3>
<p>
  If you hit the wall and can't think of what to write (writers block) just write whatever comes into your head for a while until your training thoughts start moving again. This gives your brain time to regenerate and get into a studying focus. This technique also allows your to brainstorm many ideas about whatever you are working on, expanding your knowledge on the subject.
