    <h2>Welcome to our guide</h2>
    <p>This guide was made as part of a 2020 IST (Information Software Technology) project. <br>
    The aim was to create an engaging website based on the school diary using HTML, CSS and Javascript. You can see the other group's websites <a class="uniformButton" href="https://mmawbyrc.github.io/IST/">here</a>.</p>
    <p>This guide has been made separately from Roseville College and any views expressed are not that of the College.</p>
    <h3>Amelie</h3>
    <p>I really enjoyed learning HTML, Javascript and CSS because now I am able to work on my own websites and projects without any limitations. The pages I made are <a href='winteruniform.html' class="uniformButton">'Winter Uniform'</a> and <a href='expectations.html' class="uniformButton">'Study Expectations'</a>.</p>
    <h3>Bianca</h3>
    <p> I really enjoyed this project and I think it's great to learn HTML, CSS and Javascript. The pages I made are the <a href='summer.html' class="uniformButton">Summer Uniform</a> and <a href='schoolbehaviour.html' class="uniformButton"> Behaviour at school</a> pages.
    <h3>Rebecca</h3>
    <p>I really like IST and have enjoyed learning a new coding language. The pages I made are <a href='studytips.html' class='uniformButton'>Study Tips</a> and <a class='uniformButton' href='publicbehaviour.html'>Behaviour in Public</a></p>

  <h3>Games page</h3>
  <p>The last grok challenge was to create a game. On our website we have hidden a link to our group's 3 games. But can you find them? When you are ready, click the button below </p>
<p>First clue: An important part of a game are the visuals</p>
