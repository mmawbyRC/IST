<! Hi Am/Beak (whoever sees it first), I did some work on the thing
  And I added comments so you can kinda understand what I did,
  I might do more work tmr (sunday) but i'm not rly bothered rn.

  I've got the thing checking the amount of work done (kinda)
  But it's not checking if it's bigger or smaller. Hope you can kinda
  understand what i mean in my comments, but if not I can tell u guys on
  Mon.

they are stoopid). i can try and fix it but i might be too stupid
