    <h3>Students are expected to study/revise class content and work to prepare for tests and assessments.</h3>
    <h2>Diary use</h2>
    <p>We suggest that studnets use a diary or planner to keep track of homework assesments and schedule.<br>
      Students are annualy provided with a school diary to upkeep this expectation however, we do understand that some students may prefer to use their own diary/planner.
    <h2>Note taking</h2>
    <p>One way of studying is taking notes. We personally find this one of the most convinient and useful ways of studying. We like it because it allows for quick studying and revision.
      To study through notetaking is very simple. All you have to do is write out the main points of information for the topic the test/assessment is on. It is best to write notes at the end of each topic so that when it comes to a big test or assessment, all you have to do is consolidate and read/study your notes.
      There are many different styles of notetaking and its best to find the one for you. Below are some examples.
    </p>

        <img src="../images/mindmap.jpg" alt="Mind map notes" width="600" height="400">
      </a>
      <div class="desc"><h3>Mind map</h3><p>These notes are very useful to show how ideas link with each other and the use of images and diagrams can help jog your memory.</p></div>

        <img src="../images/chart method.png" alt="Table study notes" width="600" height="400">
      </a>
      <div class="desc"><h3>Chart/table</h3><p>This method is good for notes that involve lots of statistics or things that you have to learn off heart. These notes are very useful in most subjects and can be easily read to find the correct information.</p></div>

      </a>
      <div class="desc"><h3>Pretty notes</h3><p>These notes are made to be colour coordinated and look good.Some people enjoy taking extra time and care into their notes. Making notes that are aesthetically pleasing can help some people remember better.</div>
    </div>


    <h2>Healthy Eating</h2>
    <p>Eating healthy and certain foods allows for more effiecient studying. Some recommended foods are:
      <ul>
        <li>Fish - Fish contains Omega-3 fats that are essential to brain function</li>
        <li>Blueberries - Blueberries contain antioxidants that act against stress and can help improve the communication between brain cells</li>
        <li>Protein - Proteins such as nuts, meat and eggs can help to improve your mood and brain performance.</li>
    <h2>Workspace</h2>
    <h3>It is important to have a workspace that is clean and easy to focus in to maximise study time.</h3>
    <p>Have a workspace that is free from distractions and is clean so that you can utilise the space. When studying or doing homework, try to minimise your number of breaks by setting up a good workspace with things such as water and equipment needed for your task. Instead of thinking to yourself "I'm thirsty.. Time for a break!", have water nearby to drink and schedule your breaks as a reward for completing a task. If you get hungry, eat a healthy snack.</p>
    <h2>Stress</h2>
    <p>If you are feeling extremely stressed out, please contact either your year advisor, Ms Van Arkkels or your teacher for that subject.</p>
